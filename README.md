# prime_colemak

This is based on
[the_primeagen's](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards) keyboard layout.
Keys are remapped while using the kinesis 360, so they work the best for other
keyboards.

## base layer

## shift layer

## install

follow this
[tut](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/install-custom-keyboard-windows-10/)

download the `.klc` file and load it to the layout creator then build dll.

## warning: ctrl layer doesn't work somehow... not sure why

Theres an [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script as an alternative.
Works well in my experience.
